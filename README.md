# 🏊 42Piscine

_Piscine_ is a french term meaning "swimming pool" that refers to a intensive and immersive programming boot camp that serves as the entry point to 42 school course.

During the piscine, prospective students, known as "pisciners", undergo a rigorous four to six-week evaluation period where they are introduced to the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving.

The piscine is designed to identify individuals with the potential to excel in the field of computer science, regardless of their background or prior experience.

Talking about me, I undertook the #7 C piscine at 42 Porto, which took place on 2023/08. I improved my skills and achieved remarkable feats throughout this enriching journey. Notably, I secured the 2nd position in my piscine cohort, significantly bolstering my coalition's success as we emerged victorious in the boot camp.

The #7 piscine at 42 Porto comprised a comprehensive curriculum featuring 16 solo projects, 4 rigorous exams, 3 intense rushes, and culminated in a collaborative BSQ group project. Below, I provide an overview of my performance during this demanding yet rewarding experience.

## Exams

The piscine exams at 42 are renowned for their rigorous nature. Throughout my journey, participants were permitted only a pen, a bottle of water, and a computer devoid of internet access. Any form of noise or conversation was strictly prohibited, creating an environment of focused concentration.

My initial attempt at the exams was fraught with nerves and a lack of preparation, leading to a less-than-ideal performance. However, I quickly rebounded and managed to improve myself for subsequent exams, ultimately showcasing my resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges.

## Rushes

Rushes are group projects that happen during the weekends of the piscine. They are intensive and demanding endeavors that test the skills, resilience, and teamwork of students.

In total, there are three rush projects. Unfortunaly, during my during piscine I was not able to accomplish any of them, but by trying, I was able to acquire insane communication skills, teammork, and problem-solving capabilities. These skills help me a lot later in completing other C piscine projects.

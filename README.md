# 42Piscine

_Piscine_ is a French term meaning "swimming pool" that refers to a intensive and immersive programming boot camp that serves as the entry point to 42 school course.

During the piscine, prospective students, known as "pisciners", undergo a rigorous four to six-week evaluation period where they are introduced to the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving.

The piscine is designed to identify individuals with the potential to excel in the field of computer science, regardless of their background or prior experience.

Particularly, I did the #7 C piscine of 42 Porto and acquired great skills and some achievements through my journey. It had a total of 16 solo projects, 4 exams, 4 rushes and a final BSQ group project. Below you can see how I performed.

## Exams

## Rushes

Rushes are group projects that happen during the weekends of the piscine. They are intensive and demanding endeavors that test the skills, resilience, and teamwork of students.

In total, there are four rush projects. Unfortunaly, during my during piscine I was not able to accomplish any of them, but by trying, I was able to acquire insane communication skills, teammork, and problem-solving capabilities. These skills help me a lot later in completing other C piscine projects.
